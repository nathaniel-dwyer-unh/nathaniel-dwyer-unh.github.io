    <p>My name is Nathaniel, and I’ve been yoyoing for almost 7 years now. I’ve performed at several venues including summer camps and a couple of theatrical performances. I was first inspired to take up the hobby when I saw street performers in Boston when I was a kid. A few weeks later I talked my mom into getting me a yoyo and a trickbook from the bookstore and since then I’ve been having fun practicing and performing. I’ve always found yoyoing as a great way to relax and keep my hands busy while expressing my creativity. I hope that all of you that are interested can enjoy the skill as much as I do!</p>

This website will become a base for my final project, which will be about yoyos, their history, and how they are used today

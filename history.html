    <h2 class="subhead">History</h2>
    <p>While the actual origin of the yoyo is unclear, the first historical record of the toy was found in Greece in ~500 B.C. In ancient Greece, part of a child's transition to adulthood was to offer their childhood toys to the gods, which many historians believe these yoyos were used for.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Much later down the timeline, in the 16th century, the yoyo was used as a hunting weapon in the Phillipines. Hunters would take a large rock or stone and tie it to the end of a rope. The hunter would then hide and wait for their prey, where they would throw the rock at the animal to kill it. Since the rock was tied to the rope, the hunter could then retrive the rock for reuse.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In France during the 18th century the yoyo was seen as a great stress reliever. Some military leaders would play with their yoyo before battle to calm their nerves. during its time in France, the toy was given the name "joujou de Normandie", possibly where today's term "yoyo" is derived from.</p>
    <br>
    <p>During the 18th century the return top made its way into the United States where extra rim weight was added to the toy's design, which was patented by Charles Kirchof. Soon, hand-carved wooden yoyos were made, but with a slightly different design aspect; the string was looped around the axel instead of tied. Until this point in history, all yoyos were made by tying the string to the yoyo's axel so that the yoyo would bouce back up the string once it had reached the end. By looping the string around the axel, the yoyo could now "sleep" or spin at the bottom of the string. This concept would later become the basis of modern yoyoing.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In 1929 Donald Duncan, a businessman, saw the yoyo's potential as a product, so he founded the Duncan Yoyo Company, a company that still thrives today. This was the start of the idea of the modern yoyo that we know and love today.</p>

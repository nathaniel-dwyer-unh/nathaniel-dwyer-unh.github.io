    <h2 class="subhead">The Modern Concept of the Yoyo</h2>
    <p>Today, the yoyo is seen as a skill toy used both casually and professonaly. The way people have played with the toy has changed over the past several years, evolving it from a kids trinket to a competitor's tool. Today large (even worldwide) competitions are held for yoyoing where some of the best performers show off their years of practice and skill. There are now thousands of different yoyos that are used around the world by hundreds of yoyo professionals, or in the yoyoing world, "Throwers". Other than competitions, many of these throwers host after-school programs and events to spread the love of the hobby as well as teach new people how to yoyo.</p>
